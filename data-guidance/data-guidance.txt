NEET age 16 to 24
2021 Calendar Year

Description

This document describes the data included in the ‘NEET 16-24’ National Statistics release’s underlying data file. This data is released under the terms of the  Open Government License.

The technical document published with the release should be referenced alongside this data. It provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality as well as explaining methodology used in producing the data.

Coverage

The data used in this publication covers young people who reside in England, and is based on the academic age as of 31st August. The publication’s underlying data contains individual age data between 16 and 24 years of age as well as summary age groups, 16/17, 16-18, 16-24, 18-24 and 19-24. It also includes labour market status, gender and regional breakdowns.

As a result of user feedback and internal review, from March 2018 DfE changed the periodicity of the England NEET Brief Statistics publication to an annual release to be published in February/March each year following the release of final quarter Labour Force Survey data, relating to the October to December quarter.

Quarterly NEET estimates for the UK are published by the Office for National Statistics. They differ to the figures in the DfE NEET brief as they are for the whole of the UK, are based on calendar age and are seasonally adjusted.

File formats and conventions

The underlying data files contain unrounded figures as estimated from the survey data as outlined in the accompanying technical documentation.

No suppression has been applied, as the data is not considered sensitive and no additional characteristic or geography variables are included to enable individuals to be accurately identified.
